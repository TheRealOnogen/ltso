WARNING: To boot in qemu on legacy bios you need to put the image first and then the drive you're gonna be installing to

Windows 11/10 LTS O is a custom build of Windows

What does LTS O mean?

LTS O means Long Term Support by Onogen, this os is customized specifically to be

1. Light (Windows IoT Enterprise LTSC based)
2. Have long term support from microslop
3. Be fast
4. Have no bloat
5. No copilot or AI at all
6. Edge fully removed except webview

What i will NOT be doing

1. Making LTS O build of an OS older than Windows 10
2. Making custom builds for some people specifically
3. Installing apps into the OS that some people don't need
4. Fixing bugs that Microslop made
